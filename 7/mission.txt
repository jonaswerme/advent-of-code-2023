    # Rules:
    # A is always highest card, never lowest
    # 5 of a kind > 4 of a kind > full house > straight > 3 of a kind > 2 pairs > 1 pair > high card
    # If two hands are of the same type, reading from left to right, the hand with the
    # higher top card wins.

    # Bidding:
    # Bids are available for each hand given
    # The hand is ranked based on how strong it is where lowest rank is number 1 and highest is
    # the amount of hands given
    # The bid is multiplied by the rank of the hand to get the amount won

    # Approach:
    # Use card and hand classes to represent the data
    # Score the cards for card vs card comparison
    # Assign a power of the hand based on the rules
    # Create sorting rules in the classes (__lt__, __gt__, __eq__)
    # Sort the hands based on power and score
    # Calculate winnings
